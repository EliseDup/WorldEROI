## How to run the model
Download the source files from git from a terminal with the following command (or directly via the website) :

`git clone https://github.com/EliseDup/WorldEROI`

The main function of the model is world_grid.world_grid_eroi() that return a pandas dataframe with a row per grid cell.
It contains all the information to estimate the wind and solar potential in every geographical location: estimated energy outputs [EJ/year], energy inputs [EJ/year] and associated EROI [-]
