## Content
The main function of the model is world_grid.world_grid_eroi() that returns a pandas.dataframe with a row per grid cell.

The dataframe contains all the information to estimate wind and solar potential in every geographical location.

Input data from external databases are described in XLS file: *data/Legend_Wind_Solar_Data.xls*
* Latitude
* Longitude
* GHI : global horizontal irradiation [kWh/m^2/day]
* DNI : direct normal irradiation [kWh/m^2/day]
* ...

Then the estimated energy produced and energy inputs are computed within the *world_grid.world_grid_eroi()* method for every renewable technology considered.

* wind_onshore_e, wind_offshore_e, pv_e, csp_e = estimated energy outputs [EJ/year]
* wind_onshore_e_in, ... : energy inputs [EJ/year]
* wind_onshore_eroi, ... : associated EROI [-]
* ...

## How to run the model
Download the source files from git from a terminal with the following command (or directly via the website) :

`git clone https://github.com/EliseDup/WorldEROI`

* Download the dataframe from a python command line. 

First install the dependencies :
  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then launch python and load the database with the world_grid_eroi() method :

`>>> import world_grid`

`>>> df = world_grid.world_grid_eroi()`


Ignore the 'ParserWarning' and 'DtypeWarning'.

That is it, you should have all the date in your dataframe *df*.


* Or ... Do more with the model with a Python IDE like PyCharm :-)
